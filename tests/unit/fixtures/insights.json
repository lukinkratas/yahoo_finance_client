          "reportTitle": "Stocks gave up some more ground on Wednesday and (probably not surprising) two-day losing streaks have not been very common since the secondary low traced out on April 21. The S&P 500 has given back only 0.9% over the past two days, so we can't make much out of it. The index fell 1.3% over the two days ending September 2, and 2% going into August. Prior to that, we have seen two-day losses of more than 1% only twice (in May). This illustrates what we all know: the mega-cap index has been in an extremely tight uptrend for multiple months, with very bullish price action. Despite the many reasons for a pullback (including overbought and divergent momentum, weakening breadth, high bullish sentiment, and lousy seasonals), the market has ignored the concerns and crawled higher.    We are in the weakest part of the year, as the back half of September historically has not been a good time to own stocks. But so far this year, there has not been much in the way of downside action. Going back to 1950, we can find average losses for every day of September starting with September 20 and extending until September 30. The larger losses tend to occur over the last six trading days of the month (which started on Tuesday this year).   By some measures, sentiment recently kicked into high gear, especially in the options market. The CBOE equity-only put/call (PC) ratio has been fairly low for the past two days, at 0.45 and 0.47. The average daily put/call in 2025 is around 0.60. The five-day has fallen to 0.5, the lowest in four months and just before a minor pullback. However, as long as the 21-day P/C is falling (and it is), it is bullish for stocks. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

The Vortex Indicator remains bearish while the neutral CTM Trend Meter turned higher recently. The daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) is in negative territory but is trying to turn higher. Once again, momentum strength from back in mid-June has faded hard. The COT data is bullish, and its configuration is similar to back in April, late last year, and early last year. Each time, crude oil rallied. Crude oil sentiment is neutral to bearish.

We saw some minor sell signals on August 1, but they have been erased. The major indices rallied last week, albeit in choppy fashion, with up days on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and down days on Tuesday and Thursday.  The sell signals and warnings that we had on August 1 included a bearish crossover of the five-day- and 13-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), a break of the 21-day EMA, and the cycling of the Vortex indicator into negative territory. In addition, price volatility picked up following the July 31 bearish reversal, and that can be a bad sign after a big advance. The 21-day rate of change (ROC) got very close to cycling into negative territory before popping last week. We still have two bearish divergences on the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) after cycling into extreme overbought territory -- a warning, but not a sell signal.   For now, it looks like the major indices could be at the start of another leg higher, with the S&P 500 (SPX) just missing a closing all-time high on Friday and the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 reaching closing highs. The Commitment of Traders (COT) data for the SPX remains bullish, but is bearish for the Nasdaq 100. The data for the volatility index (VIX) is bullish, suggesting we could see another move higher and then an eventual pullback in the stock market.

While only one day, that type of action is not what the bulls want to see. Selling into strength is something that the smart money does very well, but those players don't want to make their defensive moves obvious and try to hide their distribution on an up day. As we said, we are rolling into earnings season with huge gains since the April bottom. As such, it's possible that it may not be enough for companies to \"just\" beat on earnings and raise guidance.  Most of the recent big gainers on the S&P 500 have low relative strength. So we classify this as a low-quality rally. Beaten-up stocks, going into EPS season, have low expectations, so it's not hard to please Wall Street. Generally, these stocks have decent short positions, so any kind of decent news will get the shorts scrambling and taking profits.   Checking in on the S&P 500, we do not see much when it comes to technical trouble. The index has been riding its five-, 10-, and 13-day exponential averages higher since April 23. Every dip has been gobbled up, as more and more investors joined the bullish ranks. Remember, this has taken quite a bit of time in the context of one of the most hated rallies in memory.   While we still do not see a lot of technical red flags, we do note a bearish momentum divergence with respect to the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100.

          "reportTitle": "Living in the 'Yeah But' Economy The consensus on the economy, the stock market, and the employment situation is that there is not much of a consensus. Each indicator remains reasonably healthy, but with question marks. Investors are watching each new data point carefully, but with little confidence that they mean what they seem to mean. And no one is quite sure what is coming next. The bond market is spooked by the deficit implications of 'The One Big Beautiful Bill,' yet interest rates are moving down from recent peaks. The sudden resurgence of the Israel-Iran conflict adds a new layer of uncertainty to what was already an opaque environment, yet it too showed signs of receding in importance in the U.S. stock market. Tariff uncertainty remains the biggest complication in the outlook, but the response to tariffs is far from universal. In the face of any sign that tariffs have compromised or have not compromised economic growth, there is a 'yeah but' waiting in the wings. Tariffs are bad; 'yeah but' they had an immaterial impact in the first Trump administration and have not seemed to slow the economy much this time. Okay, then we can live with tariffs; 'yeah but' most tariffs are paused and not yet dragging on the economy, and we have yet to really feel the impact of reciprocal tariffs from our trading partners.  With the consensus being no consensus, and with normal business planning replaced by ad hoc approaches that flex based on day-to-day realities, investors are left to do what they always do: parse the economic data (perhaps a little more carefully) and listen to Fed-speak (though perhaps a little more closely).  Economic Data Not Showing Much of a Tariff Impact The big concern with tariffs is that they will slow employment growth and raise prices. First-quarter GDP was the one place where tariffs clearly showed up in the data. But that reflected anticipatory actions rather than actual tariff impacts. First-quarter U.S. GDP declined 0.2%, reflecting a nearly five-percentage point subtraction to GDP due to companies loading up on imported goods ahead of the April 2 'Liberation Day' tariffs. Private inventories rose over 2.5 percentage points, as all those goods had to go somewhere.  Corporate capital spending (non-residential fixed investment) also ramped up with double-digit growth, while consumer spending (personal consumption expenditures) grew moderately. Second-quarter GDP, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow predictor, is on track for nearly 4% growth given that imports (subtractive to growth) will be nearly non-existent after the first-quarter splurge.  Outside of GDP, most of the data lends itself to a 'yeah but' interpretation. The first big data point of June, nonfarm payrolls for May, slightly exceeded consensus expectations. The U.S. economy created 139,000 new jobs in May, better than the 129,000 consensus estimate, though down from a revised 147,000 for April. Unemployment remained at 4.2%, in line with consensus and the prior-month level. And hourly wages grew at a healthy 3.9% annual rate, roughly in line with the 4% trend of recent years.  In the 'yeah but' category, April job gains were revised lower by 30,000 and March payrolls by 65,000. That pushed three-month average monthly jobs growth down to 135,000 from 155,000 prior to the May report. Some questioned the quality of jobs, with heavy concentration of new jobs in relatively low-wage areas such as healthcare (78,000 new jobs). The manufacturing sector, which gained 5,000 jobs in April, shed 8,000 in May. Other nonservice industries, such as mining, oil and gas extraction, and construction, were little changed. Federal government employment declined by 22,000 and is down by 59,000 since January. That is much less than the 284,000 federal layoffs announced this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Of note, former federal employees receiving ongoing severance payments are not yet counted as unemployed.  The second big data point in June was in the form of the May CPI report, which came in a little bit better than expected. All-items CPI increased 0.1% month over month while the consensus and prior-month reading were both 0.2%. Headline CPI rose 2.4% year over year, also a tick better than the 2.5% consensus. Looking at core inflation, CPI excluding food and energy rose 0.1% month over month and 2.8% year over year.  In the 'yeah but' category, both all-items and core inflation remain frustratingly above the Fed's 2% target level. In the 'yeah but, but' category, two stubborn inflation series, transportation services and shelter, have declined meaningfully. These typically sticky categories have kept overall inflation elevated even as goods inflation has backed down in the past year. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for May rose 0.1% from April. That was better than the 0.2% consensus call, but worse than the negative reading (-0.2%) for April. The annual change in core PPI was 2.6%, in line with consensus and up from 2.4% for the previous 12-month period. Core PPI (excluding food, energy, and trade services) was up 0.1% monthly and 2.7% annually. Consumer sentiment as recorded by the University of Michigan's Consumer Center bounced higher to 60.5 in June from a cycle low of 52.2 in the prior month. Likely driving this recovery is the recent CPI and PPI data, which are not yet showing meaningful price pressure from tariffs or from other administration policies. The 'yeah but' here could come from the 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum that went into effect early in June, right after the UMich survey closed.  While these new duties will take time to work through the economy, economists expect hefty steel and aluminum tariffs to push up prices for vehicles, appliances, and new home construction. Prices for these goods are already very high, and new tariffs risk pushing prices out of reach for more and more consumers. Another 'yeah but' is the willingness or ability of goods manufacturers to absorb tariffs rather than pass them on to buyers. Fed Expected to Stand Pat As of this writing, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) had not yet concluded its June 17 and 18 meeting. Heading into that meeting, the CME's FedWatch tool showed a very low possibility of any change in rate policy. The probability of the Fed's target range for the fed funds rate remaining at 4.25%-4.50% was 99.9% as of 6/16/25.  Early in his second term, President Trump pressured the Fed to cut rates 'immediately,' but backed off when his own administration officials suggested that threats to Fed independence were tanking the dollar and the Treasury market. The White House and GOP need the bond market to be well-behaved, given that the prospect of higher deficits from 'The One Big Beautiful Bill' are putting upward pressure on interest rates.  The generally positive May CPI and PPI data did not go unnoticed in Washington. The White House responded to the good inflation data by reviving pressure on the Fed to cut rates. In making their case, administration officials also pointed to rate cuts recently announced overseas. In May and June 2025, central banks cut interest rates in China, the UK, India, and the Eurozone.  The real focus of economists after the June FOMC meeting will be on the post-meeting commentary and the so-called 'dot plot,' which signals what Fed governors are currently thinking about the likely timing of future changes in Fed policy. Over the remainder of 2025, the FOMC meets again in July, September, October, and December. Currently, the CME's FedWatch tool shows less than a 20% probability that the Fed will cut rates at its July meeting. At the September meeting, the probability of a rate cut rises to 56%, and by the October meeting, the probability that the Fed funds target rate will still be at 4.25%-4.50%, as it has been all through this year, is less than 20%. The 'yeah buts' for rate-cut timing and rate-cut magnitude are numerous. If inflation rises again due to tariffs, the geopolitics of oil supply, or other factors, the Fed may dig in its heels and hold rates steady into year-end regardless of White House pressure. If job growth slows or swings negative and unemployment begins to climb, the Fed may be inclined to cut rates more aggressively than currently planned. That would accord with White House wishes, but it would also likely signal worrisome deceleration in the economy.  Conclusion Late in January, the second term for President Trump began with a mix of excitement and uncertainty regarding the new administration. Five months in, there is still a lack of clarity on the final tariff schedule, government tax policy and spending, immigration policy, and international relations. Through this period, the chief 'yeah but' is that the economy keeps chugging along.  Corporations have shown resilience in preserving sales and earnings growth targets, because they are not truly the monoliths they may seem to be. Instead, corporations are aggregations of their departments and sub-departments, each charged with using any and all tools to keep their unit's P&L in the green. Those unit P&Ls pile up in a pyramid, producing consolidated profit growth that tends to surprise to the upside each and every reporting period.  This was true during the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply-chain crisis, and other past times of financial stress. And it is likely to remain true throughout the tariff transition period, notwithstanding all the 'yeah buts.'",

          "reportTitle": "Since April 21 (or since the secondary market low and eight days after \"the\" closing low of the correction in the major indices), stocks have enjoyed a massive and consistent tailwind. The S&P 500 (SPX) has risen in 16 out of 19 trade days, and the three daily losses were inconsequential. Since the April 8 bottom, the SPX has soared 19.6% in 27 days, the Nasdaq has surged 26%, and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has popped 25%. That performance is the best since, and very reminiscent of, the pandemic. As well, those 27-day returns (ex. the pandemic) are the best since April 2009, when stocks were coming out of the financial crisis.    With this kind of steady and persistent rally pushing the SPX to within 3% of its February 19 all-time high, the Nasdaq to within 5% of its December 16 all-time high, and the QQQ to within 3.3% of its February 19 all-time high, one would expect the investment masses to be pushing the \"very bullish\" sentiment button. Indeed, they almost always have in the past, as sentiment follows price. But that is not the case with this rally, although some indicators are finally pushing to extreme bullish levels.  The five-day CBOE equity-only put/call (PC) ratio has dropped to 0.48 from 0.73 on April 8, the lowest and most-overheated P/C since July 2023, just before the July through August pullback. Hedge fund exposure and the NAAIM Exposure Index have not reached extreme levels, consumer confidence has hit its lowest level since the pandemic, and, within the consumer-sentiment survey, more participants believe stocks will move lower.

Indeed, when global uncertainty increases, investor seek a safe haven for assets. That trend has started to unwind a bit in 2025.

That is far above the consensus that called for EPS growth of about 3%-8% and follows 17% growth in 4Q24 EPS and 9% growth in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For the current quarter, Healthcare is the leading sector, with earnings up 45%, and Energy is the bottom, down 18%.  On the economic calendar, the big event is the Fed's rate decision comes on Wednesday. Odds are only at 3% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool.

'This indicator has massive importance because it is one of the few that focuses on the dominant sector of the U.S. economy. The 'steady Eddie' services category represents a massive 47% of GDP and may be an important line of defense against further GDP contraction as the drag from imports should moderate. Services grew 2.4% in 1Q and contributed 1.1 point of growth that offset the quarterly decline in GDP. ISM Index values above 50 indicate that the services sector is generally expanding. March's reading was 50.8. Our estimate for April is 50.2. Consensus is 50.4.' Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure forecasts 1.1% for 2Q. This follows the surprise decline of 0.3% for 1Q GDP printed last week. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.2% rate for CPI in May, which is lower than the April rate and close to the Fed's 2.0% target. Mortgage rates ticked down by 5 basis points (bps) last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.76%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices fell a penny to an average of $3.13 per gallon for regular gas.  After this week, the Fed's next meeting is on June 18, with odds at 42% for a rate cut (lower than last week's odds), according to the CME FedWatch rate tool.

          "reportTitle": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments? During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.",

          "title": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments? During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream.

Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was lower by 0.2%, the S&P 500 lost 1.4%, and the Nasdaq shed 1.5%. For the year, the Dow is higher by 12%, the S&P is up 20%, and the Nasdaq has gained 22%. The earnings calendar is packed again. On Monday, Palantir Technologies, Marriott International, and American International Group all report. On Tuesday, Apollo Global Management, Yum! Brands, DuPont, Cummins, and Archer-Daniels Midland. On Wednesday, Qualcomm, McKesson, Novo Nordisk, Toyota Motor, and Take-Two Interactive. On Thursday, Motorola, Arista Networks, Airbnb, Becton, Dickinson, and Duke Energy. And on Friday, Paramount Global. So far, 349 (or 70%) of the S&P 500 companies have reported. Earnings are coming in 8.4% higher than in the prior-year quarter. Communication Services, up 24%, and Technology, up 19%, are leading, while Energy, down 27%, is underperforming. For full year, Argus forecasts earnings growth of 7%-9%. On the economic calendar, the big day is Thursday, when the Federal Reserve comes out with its next decision on interest rates. Odds that the Fed will cut by 25 basis points (bps) are essentially at 100%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Wall Street will focus on Chairman Powell's statement at the press conference immediately following the rate announcement. Meanwhile, Factory Orders will be updated on Monday; the U.S. Trade Deficit and ISM Services on Tuesday; and Consumer Sentiment on Friday.  Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja's Call of the Week is the Institute for Supply Management's Services Index for October. Chris has offered the following commentary. 'This is an early and important indicator of 4Q economic activity. Consumer spending on services represents more than 45% of GDP. The huge category includes housing expenses, including rent, healthcare, transportation services, and food services and hotels. The Services Index printed at a healthy and expansionary 54.9 in September. We expect a small uptick to 55 in October, just above the consensus of 53, which suggests the economy is healthy and will keep growing.' The services category grew 2.6% in 3Q and contributed 1.21 points of the 2.8% increase in 3Q GDP according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.   Last week, the October jobs report delivered a mixed bag of information. Nonfarm Payrolls posted at 12,000 for October compared to a strong (but revised lower) 223,000 for September. The October number was impacted by the two recent hurricanes and the strike at Boeing, but still came in lower than expected. The Unemployment Rate was unchanged at 4.1%.  Mortgage rates jumped for a fifth consecutive week and are now at 6.72% for the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Gas prices fell four cents to $3.10 per gallon for the average price of regular gas. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow indicator is forecasting for 3Q and calls for expansion of 2.3%. The Cleveland Fed CPINow indicator for November is 2.68%. After this week's Fed rate decision, the next rate meeting is on December 18. If the Fed cuts this week, as is fully expected, the odds are at 83% for another 25-bps rate cut in December, again according to the CME FedWatch tool. We expect a rate cut this week and another in December, and then three more in 2025 (all by 25 bps).",

For one, the dollar typically tracks GDP growth trends, and we think the U.S. economic expansion is poised to slow in coming quarters as the unemployment rate ticks higher. In addition, we expect the higher rates to increase the interest payments as a percent of GDP from recent lows of 1.5%, putting a modest strain on the U.S. balance sheet; the current rate is 3.8%. Lastly, the still-elevated valuation of the greenback implies that other currencies -- and even gold or other commodities -- are possibly undervalued, and we would expect investors such as the petrodollar-fueled sovereign wealth funds to bid up those values at a measured pace over time.  For global investors, a higher dollar is a positive factor for export companies (particularly from China), as their goods become relatively cheaper in the global marketplace. But a higher dollar also can generate higher commodity prices, imported inflation, higher interest payments on global borrowings, and ultimately trade wars as U.S. exports stall.",

          "reportTitle": "The growth prospects for the artificial intelligence (AI) universe are impressive, yet hard to determine. Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of the major publicly-traded players and most of the mid-tier players, along with our industry analysts' knowledge of private players. We estimate the global AI industry amounted to about $90-$100 billion in 2021, and expect it to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when it is expected to reach $1.8 trillion in annual revenue. We expect annual growth to decelerate from the low- to mid-40% range in immediate years to the mid-30% range for years toward the end of the survey period. But determining a realistic estimate for the size of the industry is a challenge. Even for an industry that promises to redefine measuring tools, there is no measurable unit of AI output comparable to barrels of oil or tons of steel. As well, much of AI development occurs within labs and at universities, and the output is measured in tangible progress against objectives, not dollars or units of output. In the corporate world, nearly all the AI pure-play companies service micro-niches, have little measurable revenue, and are deeply unprofitable. For our list this week, we take a big picture view of three areas where AI applications are developing. In Big Tech, we believe much of the revenue and most of the profitability from AI is attributable to several giant U.S. and a few international companies that operate primarily in growth sectors such as Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary. Next, we note that China is also a hub of AI development, with companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent (though Argus follows only Alibaba). Finally, Niche Tech has significant AI activity among companies pursuing advances in IoT, vehicle electrification, autonomous driving, automation and connectivity solutions for manufacturing, warehousing, construction, and other areas. Here are featured companies followed by Argus in those three categories.",
